There are five code documents. 

Functions.R is the code of the functions used for the simulation, including the functions for the data generation, the functions for the proposed method, and the functions for the BH procedure.

Simulation.R is the code for the simulation of the proposed method on correlation. 

Simulation_regression. R is the code for the simulation of the proposed method on the regression parameters of lasso and debiased-lasso. 

RealCaseStudy.R is the code for application. 

plot.R is the code used to produce Figures using the results of Simulation.R and Simulation_regression. R.
